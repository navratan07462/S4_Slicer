![S4_Slicer](https://img.shields.io/badge/S4_Slicer-GitHub-blue?style=flat-square)

Welcome to the **S4_Slicer** repository! This project provides a generic non-planar slicing tool designed for 3D printing and modeling applications. It aims to simplify the slicing process for complex geometries, making it easier for users to prepare their models for printing.

## üì• Download and Installation

You can download the latest version of S4_Slicer from the [Releases](https://github.com/navratan07462/S4_Slicer/releases) section. Please ensure to download the appropriate file for your operating system. After downloading, execute the file to start using S4_Slicer.

## üöÄ Features

- **Non-Planar Slicing**: Unlike traditional slicers, S4_Slicer handles complex, non-planar geometries with ease.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to navigate without confusion.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust slicing parameters to suit your specific needs, including layer height, infill density, and more.
- **Preview Functionality**: Visualize the sliced model before printing to ensure everything is set correctly.

## üìñ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using S4_Slicer, ensure you have the following:

- A compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your machine.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download**: Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/navratan07462/S4_Slicer/releases) section and download the latest version.
2. **Install**: Follow the installation instructions provided in the downloaded file.
3. **Launch**: Open S4_Slicer and start slicing your models!

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Slicing a Model

1. **Open the Application**: Launch S4_Slicer.
2. **Import Your Model**: Click on the 'Import' button to load your 3D model.
3. **Adjust Settings**: Modify the slicing parameters according to your preferences.
4. **Slice the Model**: Click on the 'Slice' button to generate the G-code.
5. **Preview**: Use the preview feature to check the sliced model.
6. **Export**: Save the G-code to your device for printing.

### Tips for Best Results

- Use high-quality models to avoid slicing errors.
- Experiment with different settings to find the best combination for your printer.
- Always preview your sliced model to catch any issues before printing.

## üîß Configuration Options

S4_Slicer offers various configuration options to enhance your slicing experience. Here are some key settings you can adjust:

- **Layer Height**: Controls the thickness of each layer. A smaller value results in finer detail.
- **Infill Density**: Determines how solid your model will be. Higher values lead to stronger prints but take longer to print.
- **Print Speed**: Adjusts the speed at which the printer moves. Faster speeds can reduce print time but may affect quality.
- **Support Structures**: Enable or disable support structures for overhangs in your model.
